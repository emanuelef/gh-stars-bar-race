## Disclaimer

This bar chart animation is intended as a fun and insightful visualization of trends in GitHub repositories. The **star count** is used as an indicator of a repository's **trendiness**, rather than as a measure of its usefulness or quality.

While the animation highlights trends and demonstrates how new tools constantly emerge, itâ€™s important to remember that a high star count does not necessarily equate to practical value. For example, if usefulness were the primary metric, repositories like **Linux** would undoubtedly dominate.

Ultimately, this visualization is designed to offer some interesting insights and, above all, to be an enjoyable exploration of GitHub trends.

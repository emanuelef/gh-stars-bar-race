This serves as a disclaimer for the results displayed in this bar chart animation. The star count is used as an indicator of a repository's trendiness rather than a measure of its usefulness or quality. While the animation highlights trends and showcases how new tools constantly emerge, it’s worth noting that a high star count doesn’t necessarily equate to a repository’s practical value. For instance, if usefulness were the main metric, repositories like Linux would undoubtedly be at the top. Ultimately, this visualization is meant to provide some insights and, above all, be an enjoyable exploration of trends.

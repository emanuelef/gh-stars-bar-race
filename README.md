# GH Stars Bars

Check it out [here](https://emanuelef.github.io/gh-stars-bars/)!   
This project is just for fun, showing a bar chart race of the top-starred GitHub repositories. It’s more about exploring trends and looking back at what was popular than trying to define the “best” repos based on stars.  
Currently, the chart includes some of the most starred repositories today, but I plan to expand it by incorporating more historical data from past years to capture a broader picture of GitHub trends over time.  

## Tools Used

Data collected using [Daily Stars Explorer](https://github.com/emanuelef/daily-stars-explorer).  
For the rendering I used [Racing Bars](https://github.com/hatemhosny/racing-bars).  

## Disclaimer

This bar chart animation is intended as a fun and insightful visualization of trends in GitHub repositories. The **star count** is used as an indicator of a repository's **trendiness**, rather than as a measure of its usefulness or quality.

While the animation highlights trends and demonstrates how new tools constantly emerge, it’s important to remember that a high star count does not necessarily equate to practical value. For example, if usefulness were the primary metric, repositories like **Linux** would undoubtedly dominate.

Ultimately, this visualization is designed to offer some interesting insights and, above all, to be an enjoyable exploration of GitHub trends.
